# About BuildHelper

I'm sure we've all written scripts to help our build processes.
I hope to stop repeatedly inventing this wheel for new projects,
and to find some reusability.

To use these tools, either copy BuildHelper into your repository,
or reference it as a git submodule.  It's up to you.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jeffsw/buildhelper
pip3 install --requirement buildhelper/requirements.txt
mkdir acme/BuildHelper
cp buildhelper/* acme/BuildHelper
```

# VersionHelper Usage

## Configure for Your Project

After you've copied BuildHelper into your repo, create a configuration
file called `VersionHelper.yml` that looks like the example, below.

Use the `--help` option for more details on configuration parameters.

Example `VersionHelper.yml` configuration (YAML format):

```yaml
---
# acme/VersionHelper.yml
symbol_prefix: ACME_
touch:
  - src/acme_version.c
c_file: src/acme_version.h
c_template: BuildHelper/c.template
```

## Tag Your Build

Use git tags to identify your project's version numbers.
```shell
git tag -a release-1.0 -m "I am declaring this commit to be release 1.0"
git push && git push --tags
```

## Run VersionHelper

Then, simply run the tool:

```console
jsw@athena:~/acme$ BuildHelper/VersionHelper.py
#VersionHelper running on ./
#VersionHelper C BuildHelper/c.template -> src/acme_version.h
#VersionHelper touched src/acme_version.c
#VersionHelper had 2 effects
```

Or add VersionHelper to your `Makefile` (or other build system config):
```Makefile
# run VersionHelper before building acme_version.o
src/acme_version.o: src/acme_version.c
    BuildHelper/VersionHelper.py
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(INCLUDES) -c $< -o $@

# always rebuild src/acme_version.o so it stays up to date
.PHONY: src/acme_version.o
```

## Check the Results

Now, we have an updated `src/acme_version.h` file.  If you know C, you'll
see this defines several macros and declares some string variables which,
when combined with src/acme_version.c, allows other parts of the project
to simply refer to those strings.

If you don't want all that, just edit the template `c.template` to suit
your preferences.

```C
#pragma once
#ifndef ACME_VERSION_H
#define ACME_VERSION_H
/**
 * @file This file is generated by VersionHelper.py at build time
 * See also https://github.com/jeffsw/buildhelper/
 */

#define ACME_VERSION_BUILD_HOST "athena"
#define ACME_VERSION_BUILD_TIME "Tue Jan 16 23:59:28 2018"
#define ACME_VERSION_BRANCH "master"
#define ACME_VERSION_COMMIT "6d4b94ebfcf8b8772368e79b0745395137f1724d"
#define ACME_VERSION_DESCRIBE "r1.1"
#define ACME_VERSION_STRING "1.1"

extern const char * acme_version_build_host;
extern const char * acme_version_build_time;
extern const char * acme_version_branch;
extern const char * acme_version_commit;
extern const char * acme_version_describe;
extern const char * acme_version_string;

#endif /* ifndef ACME_VERSION_H */
```

## Tips

Consider adding your output files (like `version.h`) to your
project's `.gitignore` as you shouldn't want them in your repo; you
want those files to arise at build time.

```console
jsw@athena:~/acme$ echo "src/acme_version.h" >> .gitignore
```

To list all your builds, just run `git tag --list`.

To check out a previous build, `git checkout <tag name>`.  Don't be
surprised if this puts your working directory into detached HEAD
state.  That's normal!
